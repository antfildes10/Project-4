## Design and Planning

KartControl was carefully designed with user experience, data integrity, and scalability as primary concerns. The planning process involved creating entity relationship diagrams, user flow maps, and wireframes before any code was written.

### Data Models and Relationships

The database schema was designed to normalize data appropriately while maintaining query performance. The core models include:

**User Authentication**
- Django's built-in User model extended with custom Profile model
- One-to-one relationship between User and Profile
- Profile stores role (DRIVER/MANAGER/MARSHAL) and phone number

**Track Management**
- Track model enforces single-track constraint at database level
- Contains all track information (name, address, contact details)
- Related to sessions via foreign key

**Session Management**
- SessionSlot model represents bookable time periods
- Foreign key to Track (many sessions to one track)
- Enforces start_datetime < end_datetime via clean() method
- Capacity validation prevents overselling

**Kart Fleet**
- Kart model with unique number constraint (1-99)
- Status field (ACTIVE/MAINTENANCE) controls assignment eligibility
- Related to bookings for assignment tracking

**Booking Core**
- Booking model as central entity connecting users to sessions
- Multiple validation rules:
  - Capacity checking
  - Driver overlap prevention
  - Kart availability validation
- Status workflow (PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED/CANCELLED)

**Database Diagram:** [View Entity Relationship Diagram](docs/diagrams/erd.png)

### User Flow and Navigation

The application flow was designed around intuitive navigation patterns that match user expectations:

**Guest User Flow:**
1. Land on homepage → View upcoming sessions
2. Browse sessions (filter by type/date)
3. View session details
4. Prompted to register/login to book
5. Complete registration → Auto-login
6. Return to session → Complete booking

**Driver User Flow:**
1. Login → Personalized dashboard
2. Browse available sessions
3. Book session (validated in real-time)
4. View "My Bookings" with filters
5. Manage bookings (view details, cancel if needed)
6. Receive confirmation from manager

**Manager User Flow:**
1. Login → Access admin panel
2. View pending bookings list
3. Confirm bookings (auto-assigns karts)
4. Manage sessions (create/edit/delete)
5. Manage kart fleet status
6. Mark completed sessions

**User Flow Diagram:** [View User Flow Map](docs/diagrams/user-flow.png)

### Validation and Security Design

Input validation was designed to prevent any invalid data from reaching the database while providing clear, actionable feedback to users:

**Client-Side Validation:**
- HTML5 form validation for immediate feedback
- JavaScript validation for enhanced UX
- Clear error messages next to relevant fields

**Server-Side Validation:**
- Django form validation (never trust client)
- Model-level clean() methods for business rules
- Custom validators for complex rules

**Security Layers:**
- Authentication required for booking operations
- Permission checks on every admin action
- CSRF tokens on all forms
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- XSS prevention via template escaping

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing KartControl, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.9 or higher** - Check with `python3 --version`
- **pip** - Python package installer (usually included with Python)
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **PostgreSQL** (optional) - Only required for production-like setup; SQLite used by default for development

### Local Development Setup

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antfildes10/Project-4.git
cd Project-4
```

#### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment isolates project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should now see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Django, database adapters, and all other dependencies.

#### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
touch .env  # On Windows: type nul > .env
```

Add the following configuration to `.env`:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-generate-new-one
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

**Important**: Generate a secure SECRET_KEY:

```python
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Copy the output and use it as your SECRET_KEY value.

#### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

Create all necessary database tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

You should see output confirming migrations were applied successfully.

#### Step 6: Create Superuser Account

Create an admin account for accessing the management interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set username, email, and password.

#### Step 7: Load Sample Data (Optional)

Populate the database with realistic sample data for testing:

```bash
python manage.py populate_sample_data
```

This creates:
- 1 track (KartControl Racing Track)
- 10 karts (numbered 1-10)
- 15 upcoming sessions (mix of Open and Grand Prix)
- 4 test user accounts
- 9 sample bookings

#### Step 8: Run Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

### First Time Setup Notes

- On first run, Django will create the SQLite database file (`db.sqlite3`)
- All static files are collected automatically during development
- The admin interface is available at `/admin/`
- Default sample data passwords are all `password123`

### Known Issues and Bugs

#### Resolved Bugs

All bugs discovered during development and testing have been resolved:

**Bug #001 - Booking Form Validation Error (RelatedObjectDoesNotExist)**
- **Description**: When clicking "Book Now", application crashed with `RelatedObjectDoesNotExist` error because form validation ran before session_slot was set on the booking instance
- **Impact**: High - Prevented any bookings from being created
- **Root Cause**: Form validation in `bookings/views.py` called `is_valid()` before setting `form.instance.session_slot`
- **Solution**: Reordered operations to set all instance fields (session_slot, driver, status) BEFORE calling `is_valid()`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed (commit b88e5c8)
- **Verification**: Tested with 20+ bookings, all successful

**Bug #002 - Static Files Not Loading on Heroku (500 Errors)**
- **Description**: CSS and JavaScript files returned 500 errors on production because `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` required manifest file that wasn't being generated
- **Impact**: High - Site unusable on production, no styling displayed
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect staticfiles storage backend configuration for Heroku deployment
- **Solution**: Changed `STATICFILES_STORAGE` to `CompressedStaticFilesStorage` in `production.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed (commit b88e5c8)
- **Verification**: All static files now serve correctly with proper compression

**Bug #003 - Database SSL Configuration Preventing Migrations**
- **Description**: Setting `ssl_require=True` in database configuration prevented migrations from running on Heroku with "process exited" error
- **Impact**: High - Database could not be initialized on production
- **Root Cause**: Heroku PostgreSQL handles SSL automatically; explicit `ssl_require=True` caused connection failure
- **Solution**: Removed `ssl_require` parameter from `dj_database_url.config()` call
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed (commit b15c4e0)
- **Verification**: All 22 migrations applied successfully on Heroku

**Bug #004 - Booking List Filters Not Working**
- **Description**: Clicking filter tabs (Upcoming, Pending, Confirmed, etc.) in My Bookings page had no effect; all bookings remained visible
- **Impact**: Medium - Reduced usability, made finding specific bookings difficult
- **Root Cause**: Filter logic missing from `booking_list` view in `bookings/views.py`
- **Solution**: Implemented complete filter logic handling GET parameter `?status=` with cases for "upcoming", "PENDING", "CONFIRMED", "COMPLETED", "CANCELLED"
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed (commit 70a6fc8)
- **Verification**: All filter tabs now work correctly, tested with various booking statuses

#### Unfixed Bugs

**No known unfixed bugs exist at this time.** All identified issues during development and testing have been resolved and verified fixed.

## Deployment

KartControl is deployed on Heroku using PostgreSQL for the database and WhiteNoise for efficient static file serving. The deployment follows Django best practices for production environments.

### Live Application

**Production URL**: [https://project-4-karting-121d969fb7d5.herokuapp.com](https://project-4-karting-121d969fb7d5.herokuapp.com)

### Deployment Steps - Heroku

The application was deployed to Heroku following these steps:

#### Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:
- ✅ Heroku account created ([Sign up here](https://signup.heroku.com/))
- ✅ Heroku CLI installed ([Installation guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli))
- ✅ Git repository initialized and all code committed
- ✅ `requirements.txt` up to date with all dependencies
- ✅ `Procfile` created: `web: gunicorn kartcontrol.wsgi --log-file -`
- ✅ `runtime.txt` specifying Python version: `python-3.12.6`

#### Step 1: Login to Heroku

Open terminal and authenticate:

```bash
heroku login
```

This opens a browser window for authentication. Complete the login process.

#### Step 2: Create Heroku Application

Create a new Heroku app with a unique name:

```bash
heroku create project-4-karting
```

Alternatively, create via Heroku Dashboard and then add the remote:

```bash
heroku git:remote -a project-4-karting
```

#### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

Provision a PostgreSQL database (Essential-0 tier is free):

```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0 -a project-4-karting
```

This automatically sets the `DATABASE_URL` config variable. Verify with:

```bash
heroku config -a project-4-karting
```

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Set all required configuration variables:

```bash
# Generate a new SECRET_KEY (never reuse development key)
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

# Set the generated key (replace with your actual generated key)
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY="your-generated-secret-key-here" -a project-4-karting

# Disable debug mode
heroku config:set DEBUG=False -a project-4-karting

# Set allowed hosts (use your actual Heroku app name)
heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS="project-4-karting.herokuapp.com" -a project-4-karting

# Set CSRF trusted origins (use your actual Heroku app URL)
heroku config:set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS="https://project-4-karting.herokuapp.com" -a project-4-karting

# Set Django settings module
heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="kartcontrol.settings.production" -a project-4-karting
```

#### Step 5: Verify Configuration

Check all config variables are set correctly:

```bash
heroku config -a project-4-karting
```

Expected output should include:
```
=== project-4-karting Config Vars
ALLOWED_HOSTS:          project-4-karting.herokuapp.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS:   https://project-4-karting.herokuapp.com
DATABASE_URL:           postgres://user:password@host:port/database
DEBUG:                  False
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: kartcontrol.settings.production
SECRET_KEY:             [your-secret-key]
```

#### Step 6: Deploy to Heroku

Push your code to Heroku:

```bash
git push heroku main
```

Heroku will automatically:
1. Detect Python application
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
4. Build the application
5. Start the web dyno with gunicorn

Watch the build output for any errors.

#### Step 7: Run Database Migrations

Apply all database migrations on Heroku:

```bash
heroku run "python manage.py migrate" -a project-4-karting
```

You should see output confirming all migrations applied successfully.

#### Step 8: Create Superuser

Create your production admin account:

```bash
heroku run "python manage.py createsuperuser" -a project-4-karting
```

Follow the prompts to set username, email, and password. **Save these credentials securely.**

#### Step 9: Populate Sample Data (Optional)

Load sample data for demonstration purposes:

```bash
heroku run "python manage.py populate_sample_data" -a project-4-karting
```

This creates:
- 1 track
- 10 karts (numbers 1-10, all ACTIVE)
- 15 upcoming sessions (8 Open Sessions, 7 Grand Prix)
- 4 test users (passwords all: `password123`)
  - john_driver (Driver)
  - jane_racer (Driver)
  - mike_manager (Manager)
  - sarah_marshal (Marshal)
- 9 sample bookings

#### Step 10: Open Application

Launch your deployed application:

```bash
heroku open -a project-4-karting
```

This opens your browser to the production URL.

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify everything is working:

1. ✅ Homepage loads without errors
2. ✅ Static files (CSS/JS) loading correctly
3. ✅ Session list displays data
4. ✅ User registration works
5. ✅ Login/logout functional
6. ✅ Booking creation works
7. ✅ Admin panel accessible at `/admin/`
8. ✅ HTTPS enforced (no HTTP access)
9. ✅ Security headers present

### Maintenance Commands

**View Logs** (useful for debugging):
```bash
heroku logs --tail -a project-4-karting
```

**Run Django Management Commands**:
```bash
heroku run "python manage.py [command]" -a project-4-karting
```

**Restart Application** (if needed):
```bash
heroku restart -a project-4-karting
```

**Check Application Status**:
```bash
heroku ps -a project-4-karting
```

## Development Process

KartControl was developed following professional software development practices with emphasis on code quality, testing, and version control.

### Version Control and Git Workflow

- **Git** used for comprehensive version control throughout development
- All commits follow **conventional commit format**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Small, focused commits (typically 10-100 lines changed per commit)
- **19 total commits** demonstrating clear, logical development progression
- Commit messages written in **imperative mood** as per best practices
- No large, monolithic commits - each commit represents a discrete unit of work
- Clear commit history makes it easy to understand project evolution

Example commit messages:
- `feat: add personalized homepage for logged-in users`
- `fix: implement booking list filtering functionality`
- `test: add comprehensive test suite with 78% coverage`
- `docs: create comprehensive README following Code Institute standards`

### Code Quality Standards

- **PEP 8 compliance** enforced with flake8 linter
- Maximum line length: 120 characters (flexible for readability)
- Comprehensive **docstrings** for all functions and classes (Google style)
- Consistent naming conventions:
  - `snake_case` for functions and variables
  - `PascalCase` for classes
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- No commented-out code in production
- Clear **separation of concerns** with modular design
- DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) applied throughout
- **Type hints** used where appropriate for clarity

### Testing Approach

- **Test-Driven Development** mindset (write tests early)
- **95 automated tests** covering models, views, and forms
- **78% code coverage** (90%+ on critical business logic)
- Manual testing procedures documented comprehensively
- Each feature tested with both valid and invalid inputs
- Edge cases explicitly tested and handled gracefully
- Error conditions verified to provide user-friendly messages
- Cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility verified

### AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with assistance from **Claude Code by Anthropic** for:
- Code troubleshooting and debugging
- Project planning and architecture decisions
- Deployment configuration and Heroku setup
- Code editing and refactoring suggestions
- Writing comprehensive documentation
- Test creation and validation
- Git commit message formatting

**All AI-assisted contributions are marked with co-authorship in git commits:**
```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

While AI assistance was used extensively, all code was reviewed, understood, and validated by the developer before commit. The developer maintains full understanding of the codebase and can explain all implementation decisions.
